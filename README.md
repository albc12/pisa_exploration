# PISA 2012 Dataset Exploration
## by Alicia Bosch

## DATASET

This notebook will explore the PISA 2012 dataset. This dataset collects a a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

This dataset will look at a sample of 485490 students and 16 attributes. To properly understand the average scores, we will study  features such as gender, parental level of education, class size, homework time and country.


## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

The main goals of this investigation is to answer the following questions:
- Does gender influence the resulting scores? Are there gender gaps?
- How does the parental level of education, class size and homework time influence on student's performance?
- How much do the different scores vary depending on the country?

#### How does gender influence on their results? Are there any gender gaps?
Males get better grades in Science and Maths whereas women overpass them in Reading. However, on average, males and females get similar scores. This is so because there is such a striking difference with men and women in the scores they get in Reading, that the final average score balances.  

> MATHS AND SCIENCE SCORE: The gender gap is lower in top performing countries than in low performing countries.

> READING SCORE: the gender gap (in favour of women) in reading is quite striking compared to the ones in maths and science, where men go in favour. This gender gap is even more remarkable in bottom countries. That may explain the fact that the total average score is very similar.

The gender gap is slightly better for women when looking at the total average score.

### How does homework influence the scores?
Time spent studying out of school is important but only to a point. Students benefit from more work outside the classroom. However, the benefits show a plateau effect as the time spent studying increases. This pattern is consistent across Math, Reading and Science scores.

### How does parental education influence the scores?
There is no correlation between their parents holding or not a bachelor and their resulting scores. The figures are similar for both mothers and fathers with a few less men who do finish school.

The parent's education and gender influence a lot in the time students spend working from home. Mother's who finished school hugely influence in the fact that their children study more at home. The farther Mothers arrived when schooling, the more time their kids study at home.

In contrast, the fact of parents holding or not a bachelor does influence whether students do more or less homework. Moreover, it does not influence a lot on their final scores. Mother's holding a bachelor influence a bit on the pupils final scores because kids do get a slightly better score, but nothing to highlight.

### How does class size influence on the scores?
Class size does not influence on their scores.

### How much do the different scores vary depending on the country?
Top performing countries are China, Singapore, Korea and Japan. The countries that underperform the most are Peru, Qatar, Indonesia and Brazil. China almost arrives to the 600 maximum score, whereas Peru is around the 380 score.


## KEY INSIGHTS FOR PRESENTATION

For the presentation, I will explore the points I discussed above with visualizations. However, in order to avoid a lengthy presentation, question 1 and 3 will be answered but, for question 2, the only feature that will be mentioned will the homework one.
